Lead Scoring Case Study Assignment

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

XEducation markets its courses on several websites and search engines. Once people land on their website some browse the courses, 
watch videos and some even fill the form. Upon filling the forms, the company gets their details like number, mail id with which 
the employees later approch these people to market their courses, while some do covert into customers but many do not. This creates 
very poor rate of conversion for the company.


OBJECTIVE

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the 
company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas 
a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. There are some more problems presented 
by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will 
need to handle these as well and make recommendations.
